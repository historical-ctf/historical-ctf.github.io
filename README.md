An interactive walk through the history of RSA vulnerabilities. Deployed at [https://historical-ctf.github.io](https://historical-ctf.github.io).

## Motivation

RSA is an amazing protocol, but just as amazing is the wealth of research into its vulnerabilities, which range from exploitations of the protocol's mathematical properties to implementation-based attacks.

The Historical CTF uses an interactive, Capture the Flag (CTF) format to walk through the history of RSA vulnerabilities. Along the way, users will learn about the various attacks and flaws that have been exploited over the past few decades, being pointed to papers and other resources to mark the trail.

## Contact

The Historical CTF was developed by James Evans and [Charles Marsh](http://crmarsh.com) as a final class project for Princeton's <a href="https://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/course_details.xml?courseid=010571&term=1154" target="_blank">COS 583</a>.
